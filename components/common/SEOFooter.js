        We continuously monitor the production process of your order and share

        final line inspections for custom orders - which can be done remotely
        via video meetings. We conduct a final QC for product specifications and
        a drop test as well. We can also facilitate quality testing as per your
        requirements from a certified lab at an additional fee. These quality
        standards need to be provided at the time of placing the order.<br></br>{" "}
        As soon as the production process has crossed a certain threshold, we
        plan the shipping date with the supplier. On the basis of the shipping
        date, a trusted logistics partner associated with Qalara comes and picks
        up the product. We keep a constant track of your order till the order is
        delivered to you at the designated location, ensuring fast execution and
        reliable service.

          How do I select a product from the seller catalog?
        </p>
        <p>
          We suggest that along with the product specifications you should also
          go through the supplierâ€™s profile, production methods, and the
          different art forms that they use. This will give you a unique
          perspective on product aesthetics. Our suppliers work with a wide
          variety of artisanal products from materials like wood, leather, iron,
          brass, glass, ceramic, marble, soapstone and Indian crafts like block
          printing, screen printing, batik, shibori, Ikat, woodwork, metal
          inlay, pottery, phulkari, and lot more. You can fine-tune your
          requirements and select the appropriate wholesale supplier for you.

        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Can you customise products?</p>
        <p>
          Absolutely! Colours and sizes for most of our products can be
          customised. We can also add your label and customise designs as per
          your requirements. In case you already have a design, please send us a
          picture and we will get back to you with detailed specs, post a
          discussion with the supplier. Different sellers will have specific
          MOQs for customised products and we will share the same with you.

          How do we know that goods are of the right quality and will be
          produced on time?
        </p>
        <p>
          We quality inspect all orders, manage production monitoring for custom
          orders, facilitate secure payments, offer the best freight costs and
          ensure safe door delivery. <br></br> For custom orders, we monitor the
          production of your order and share updates through the key milestones
          of the production process. We also facilitate inline and final line
          inspections for large custom orders - which can be done remotely via
          video meetings. We conduct a final Quality Inspection once goods are
          ready and review all documentation. We can also facilitate quality
          testing as per your requirements from a certified lab at an additional
          fee. These quality standards need to be provided at the time of
          placing the order and are recommended for larger orders.<br></br>
          <br></br> Once products are ready and have been inspected, a trusted
          logistics partner associated with Qalara ships the products, either by
          Air or Ocean Freight as decided at the time of placing the order. We
          keep a constant track of your order till the order is delivered to you
          at the designated location, ensuring reliable service from order
          confirmation to delivery.
