        <p className="faq-body-question">
          How does Qalara help overseas wholesale buyers?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Qalara is a global platform based in India, offering a convenient,
          reliable, digitally-enabled platform for global sourcing from South
          Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc.).
          <br></br>Specifically, we offer:<br></br>• An ever growing selection
          of artisanal, eco-friendly, organic, recycled products at great
          prices! <br></br>• Verified producers<br></br>• Small-to-mid sized,
          buyer friendly terms - MOQs, lead times and prices<br></br>• One-stop
          sourcing platform from discovery to delivery<br></br>• Account
          managers so that you don’t have to coordinate with multiple vendors
          <br></br>• Secure payments<br></br>• Best freight and shipping costs
          <br></br>• Financial services launching soon
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">How does Qalara verify its sellers?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Qalara identifies and shortlists sellers based on credible, legitimate
          associations like the World Fair Trade Organization, Craftmark, Crafts
          Council, Exports Promotions Councils, and self-declared claims against
          our six core values - Artisanal (heritage, evolved, hybrid), Organic,
          Eco-friendly, Recycled, Fair & Social, Sustainable. We then reach out
          to the sellers, once agreed on the terms and conditions, and review
          their certifications and legal compliance documentation. We also
          undertake physical factory or facility audits as best possible,
          however, owing to the unusual Covid circumstances we have been limited
          in our ability to do so to the fullest extent possible. In such
          scenarios, we also undertake reference checks and review customer or
          client feedback where possible.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">
          Why is Qalara better than other B2B online platforms?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Qalara's promise to the buyer is convenience and reliability. Qalara
          is a managed marketplace where 100% of the Sellers are verified -
          which means that all sellers have been verified and vetted by team
          Qalara. We facilitate direct, moderated interaction between buyers and
          sellers, while at the same time taking a hands-on role to ensure that
          products are produced in time and to your specifications. Qalara steps
          in to take care of cross-border logistics, and aggregating shipments
          and partners with the best companies to ensure the best costs and
          experience to both sellers and buyers. Importantly, Qalara consciously
          emphasises on its six core values - artisanal, eco friendly, organic,
          fair & social, recycled, sustainable - and aspires to have the largest
          and most reliable selection of such manufacturers.

          What is a Request for Quote, an Order Query and a Custom Quote?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          A Request for Quote (RFQ) / Order Query/ Custom Quote is a simple
          order enquiry form that you can fill out to convey your requirements.
          You can send us three types of Quote Requests: <br></br>●{" "}
          <b>Get custom Quote</b> - If you like a specific product and wish to
          order specific quantities or want to slightly customize the color or
          packaging, you can ask for a custom quote.
          <br></br>● <b>Send order Query</b> - If you like a seller’s portfolio
          and would like them to manufacture a custom design for you basis their
          skillset. This may require higher MOQs (Minimum Order Quantity) and
          longer lead times.
          <br></br>● <b>Request for Quote</b> - If you're looking to purchase
          something specific but you haven’t been able to find that product on
          our platform, we can create or curate products for you. This may
          require higher MOQs (Minimum Order Quantity) and longer lead times.
          <br></br>● <b>Add to Collection</b> - This is a new feature that
          allows you to add multiple products to create moodboards, ranges or
          collections based on a theme (say Fall2020) and you can send a Request
          for Quote for the entire collection at once!<br></br>
          Once we receive a query, we will send you a Quotation with all
          required details. If you confirm the same, we send you a payment link
          to process your order!

        <p className="faq-body-question">
          What are the different types of ordering options on Qalara?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Qalara is designed to meet all kinds of wholesale and sourcing order
          requirements - <br></br>● <strong>Ready to ship</strong> - These are
          products for which inventory is readily available with the supplier.
          Generally ready to ship products are dispatched within 7-10 days of
          the order confirmation, after being quality inspected by Qalara Many
          of these products are fast moving and can run out of stock!<br></br>●{" "}
          <strong>Express Custom</strong> - These are products that may not have
          ready inventory, but can be produced in small batches within 3-5
          weeks. These are a great alternative to ready stock that we recommend.
          There may be some exceptions, but most hard goods are able to meet
          these requirements.<br></br>● <strong>Made to order</strong> - These
          are custom orders with predefined Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ) where
          the suppliers will need to procure raw materials as per your
          requirements and then take up production. Such orders are usually
          dispatched within 45-60 days of order confirmation. Depending on the
          product specifications and quantities, they may take less or more
          time.<br></br>● <strong>Design to order</strong> - Many of our
          suppliers are happy to develop your designs or product ideas, subject
          to MOQs. Additionally, if you need any customisation in the product
          size or design then you can convey your requirements and they can be
          produced based on approved designs. Such orders usually mandate sample
          approvals. This can be a slightly longer process depending on the
          product specifications and quantities and orders are usually shipped
          within 60-90 days post-confirmation.

        <p className="faq-body-question">Can I order a sample?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          In most cases, yes! Please write to us at{" "}
          <a href="mailto:buyers@qalara.com">buyers@qalara.com</a> and mention
          the webpage address or link of the product that you like in your
          email. We may request you to fill out a Sample Request Form with an
          indicative order type and size against the sample that you request.
          Once received, we check the availability of the sample with the
          supplier and notify you of the sample delivery cost. The Seller may
          charge a premium for samples.

        <p className="faq-body-question">
          Can Qalara help me source products specific to my designs?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Yes absolutely! You can share with us design mood boards, or reference
          designs including sketches, photographs and specifications. We will in
          turn share the same with the respective sellers for them to design and
          develop products as per your designs. We also have inhouse designers
          who can guide you should you need the extra help! These orders are
          however almost always subject to higher MOQs (minimum order
          quantities) from the sellers.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">
          What do you need from us to process our order
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          After you have placed an order on our site, we may reach out to you
          for certain business-related documents or numbers that may be
          required, such as your VAT number, Business Number, EORI, Import
          Export Code, GST number, etc. These typically vary by country and are
          mandated by the shipping company to clear customs into your country.

        <p className="faq-body-question">What is a video meeting?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          A video demo is a live video meeting that facilitates direct
          conversation and interaction with the seller. Through these meetings,
          buyers can engage with sellers more deeply, check out the seller's
          product offering and understand the specifications and details of the
          different production methods and crafts. You can also share your
          specific requirements with the seller and can in turn understand your
          design preferences and expectations. You may even request a facility
          tour to get a first-hand view of behind the scenes operations. This is
          recommended for large custom orders.

        <p className="faq-body-question">ORDER FULFILMENT BY QALARA</p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">
          How do you ensure that goods will be delivered as per specifications
          and on time?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          We have dedicated production monitoring and quality control teams that
          track each order from confirmation to finalization through production
          - both inline and final if required - so that we can preempt and
          rectify and discrepancies during the production process. In case we
          anticipate delays, we step in, to caution and support the sellers if
          needed. We also do a final QC at the once goods are packed and reach
          our warehouse before shipping. We also encourage buyers to participate
          in 'remote video inspections' to be extra sure and avoid any
          surprises.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">What is production monitoring?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Once a custom order is confirmed, we provide the service of tracking
          key milestones through the production process of your order. The
          tracking process starts from the pre-production phase and continues
          until the goods are packed. We are consistently in touch with the
          supplier throughout the process and keep you updated on the status of
          your order. Each product type/ production method has a different
          monitoring process to ensure that all the key activities are tracked
          and you get your shipments in time – as confirmed to you at the time
          of placing the order.

        <p className="faq-body-question">What is Quality Inspection?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          For any order placed on our platform, we provide quality inspection
          services. For custom orders, the inspection service involves
          inspection of the products during as well as post-production. This is
          done at the seller factory/ facility and we check the products against
          the order details to ensure that the products delivered match the
          order specification. Along with this, we also inspect and test the box
          post packaging. In the current Covid situation, in some cases, we may
          need to do remote inspections or green channel the inspection through
          very reliable vendors.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">What is Quality testing?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          We have partnered with major labs in India to conduct the required
          quality testing of products. If you want to avail this service please
          write to us with your requirements. We generally suggest the critical
          tests for products that you select. We also share a final quote once
          the testing requirement has been finalized. Once ready, our suppliers
          ship the product to the nominated testing lab. As soon as the reports
          are available, we will share the same with you.

          Your checkout mentions that Freight, Taxes and Duties are ‘estimates’.
          When will I know the freight, duties and taxes that will be charged?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          The reason we mention Freight, Taxes and Duties as estimates at the
          time of placing the order is that we have seen variances in the volume
          of the final packed goods (especially for orders with mixed items from
          multiple sellers), furthermore, duties and taxes for certain products
          to countries can also periodically vary. For Ocean freight, it is at
          the time of dispatch once we have received the packed shipments (from
          across suppliers if that be the case) and have handed it over to the
          freight company and it is source cleared do we know the freight costs.
          For Air shipments, it is sometimes only known a week after the
          shipment is delivered depending on the country. Furthermore, taxes and
          duties are only known post customs clearance at destination. <br></br>
          We will therefore be able to ascertain the final accurate freight,
          duties and taxes only after we receive the invoice from the freight
          company a few weeks post delivery, and there are possibilities of
          variance in freight, tax and duties as mentioned above, but those are
          usually minimal. Any such differential amount after the actual
          freight, duties and taxes is known to us is neither charged extra to
          you, nor refunded.

        <p className="faq-body-question">
          What will be the payment terms for my Qalara order?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          For Ready to ship or Express Custom orders, we currently ask for 20%
          of the payment to be paid as advance for order confirmation. The
          balance 80% of the order amount is collected once the order is
          delivered to you. This may vary from time to time, but will always be
          mentioned clearly during checkout prior to confirming your order.{" "}
          <br></br>For Custom orders the payment schedule varies depending on
          the nature of the product and the order total. The same is
          communicated to you in advance by our team during the process of quote
          creation. Please note that for DDP shipments we reserve the right to
          deduct the balance payment after the first attempt of delivery is made
          by our logistics partner. For DDU shipment we reserve the right to
          collect the payment after 48 hours of the shipment reaching the
          destination port.

        <p className="faq-body-question">What is a Proforma invoice?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          A proforma invoice is a preliminary copy of the invoice sent to buyers
          in advance of a shipment or delivery of goods. Pro-forma invoice
          typically describes the details and cost of purchased items and the
          estimated freight and estimated customs, duties and taxes. We share
          the Proforma Invoice, immediately after you place the order in case of
          a ready to ship order or within 24 hours of placing a custom order.
        </p>

          How can I get the invoice for my order?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          We will email you a copy of the invoice with the final billing amount
          at the time of dispatch. We also share a final invoice with all
          necessary documents within 24 hours of successful delivery.
          Alternatively, once your order is delivered you can download the
          invoice from the Order section in your My Account page on Qalara

          Payment for my order failed, what should I do?

        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Just go to the My Order section in your My Account page and you will
          find the order for which the payment failed. Against the order, you

          no order is created we recommend you to wait for 3 to 5 days within

        <p className="faq-body-question">
          I'm just getting started with my business, and I don't have my
          business registrations done. Can I still order from Qalara?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          For some countries, like the UK, yes we may be able to work via our
          own / partners’ entities as an ‘Importer on Record’. In some
          countries, it may be permissible to ship goods up till a certain value
          without business details from the buyer, in which case we can still
          fulfil your order. We have to follow the laws of the land into which
          we are shipping the goods so in some other cases, we may not be able
          to do so without complying with the mandatory information. However, we
          can certainly help you get set up - in most countries where we
          deliver, the processes are fairly straightforward and digital!
