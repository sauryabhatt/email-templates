        <p className="faq-body-question">How does Qalara verify its sellers?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Qalara identifies and shortlists sellers based on credible, legitimate
          associations like the World Fair Trade Organization, Craftmark, Crafts
          Council, Exports Promotions Councils, and self declared claims against
          our six core values - Artisanal (heritage, evolved, hybrid), Organic,
          Eco-friendly, Recycled, Fair & Social, Sustainable. We then reach out
          to the sellers, once agreed on the terms and conditions, and review
          their certifications and legal compliance documentation. We also
          undertake physical factory/ facility audits as best possible, however,
          owing to the unusual Covid circumstances we have been limited in our
          ability to do so to the fullest extent possible. In such scenarios we
          also undertake reference checks and review customer/ client feedback
          where possible.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">
          What is a Request for Quote/ Order Query/ Custom Quote?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          A Request for Quote (RFQ) / Order Query/ Custom Quote is a simple
          order enquiry form that Buyers can fill out to convey their buying
          requirements for custom orders. Buyers can submit broadly three kinds
          of RFQ -<br></br>a) At a product level, if you wish to order greater
          quantities than available or lower quantities than the minimums, or
          need minor customisation in terms of color or size or packaging, etc.
          (Custom Quote)<br></br>b) At a seller level, if you like the portfolio
          of a given seller or have a design direction in mind for the seller to
          design around (Order Query)<br></br>c) At a country or category level,
          if you're just looking to purchase specific items but you havent been
          able to find a relevant Seller / Product. In these cases, we can
          curate from the existing base or specifically bring in new suppliers
          that might be relevant to you (Request for Quote)<br></br>
          Once Qalara/ Sellers receives an RFQ, we work on putting together
          Line-sheet with product specifications, prices, and other terms and
          share it back with the buyers for their review and feedback.

        <p className="faq-body-question">Is it safe to transact on Qalara?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Absolutely! From a technology perspective, we are GDPR compliant - the
          EU General Data Protection Regulation which went into effect on May
          25, 2018, replacing the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC - which
          protects user data. From a payments perspective, we only work with the
          best global payment services providers like Paypal / Visa /
          Mastercard. Furthermore, we are backed by a Fortune 100 company, that
          is listed on the leading Indian Stock Exchange (BSE), and has
          partnerships with globally reputable companies like Intel, Qualcomm,
          Facebook, amongst others. We therefore comply with highest governance
          land adherence to laws. You may refer to our Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">
          How do you ensure that goods will be delivered as per specifications
          and on time?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          We have dedicated Production Monitoring and Quality Control teams that
          track each order from confirmation to finalization through production
          - both inline and final line if required so that any issues can be
          identified upfront when it can still be rectified - and therefore
          pre-emptively keep track of all the required steps of production.
          Where we anticipate delays, we step in to caution and support the
          Sellers if the need arises. We do a final QC at location once goods
          are packed, and also encourage buyers to participate in 'remote video
          inspections' to be sure of what you're receiving, for larger orders.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">What is a video meeting?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Video demo is a live video meeting that allows buyers to have a direct
          conversational interaction with the seller. Through these meetings,
          buyers can engage with sellers more deeply -<br></br>Check out the
          seller's product offering live and understand the specifications and
          details Help supplier understand your design preferences and
          expectations
          <br></br>Interact and build your customised requirements and finalize
          pricing and other order details<br></br>You may even request a
          facility tour to get a first hand view of behind the scenes
          operations.

        <p className="faq-body-question">
          Can Qalara help me source products designed by buyers?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Yes absolutely! Buyers can share with us design moodboards, or
          reference designs including sketches, photographs and specifications,
          which we in turn share with our Sellers for them to design and develop
          products as per your designs. We also have inhouse designers who can
          guide you should you need the extra help!
        </p>

        <p className="faq-body-question">
          Why is Qalara better than other B2B online platforms?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Qalara's promise to the buyer is convenience and reliability. Qalara
          is a managed marketplace where 100% of the Sellers are verified -
          which means that Sellers cannot sign up on the platform and start
          selling without being vetted by team Qalara. Qalara facilitates direct
          moderated interaction between buyers and sellers, while at the same
          time takes a hands-on role to ensure that products are produced in
          time and to the buyer's specifications. Qalara steps in to take care
          of cross-border logistics, and aggregating shipments and partners with
          the best companies to ensure the best costs and experience to both
          sellers and buyers. Importantly, Qalara has a huge emphasis on its six
          core values - artisanal, eco friendly, organic, fair & social,
          recycled, sustainable - and aspires to have the largest and most
          reliable selection of such manufacturers.

        <p className="faq-body-question">What is production monitoring?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          For a custom order placed on our platform we provide the service of
          tracking key milestones through the production process of your order.
          The process starts from the pre-production phase and continues till
          the packing process is complete. We are consistently in touch with the
          supplier throughout the process and keep you updated on the status of
          your order. Each product type/ production method has a different
          monitoring process to ensure that all the key activities are tracked
          and you get your shipments in time – this will be informed to you at
          the time that you place the order.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">What is quality inspection?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          For any order placed on our platform we provide quality inspection
          services. For custom order the inspection service involves inspection
          of the products during as well as post the inspection process. This
          test is done on the factory/ facility floor and we check the products
          against the order specification to ensure that the products delivered
          match the order specification. Along with this, we also do an
          inspection of the packaging box and test the box post packaging. In
          the current Covid situation, we may need to do remote inspections or
          green channel the very reliable vendors.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">Can I order a sample?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Yes absolutely! Please write to us at{" "}
          <a href="mailto:buyers@qalara.com">buyers@qalara.com</a> and mention
          the webpage address of the product that you would lie in your email.
          We will check the availability of the sample with the supplier and
          notify you on the sample delivery cost. In most of the cases we charge
          only for the logistics cost of delivering you the sample.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">What is Quality testing?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          We have partnered with major labs in India to conduct required quality
          testing of products. If you want to avail this service please write to
          us with your requirements. We generally suggest the critical tests for
          products that you select. We share a final quote once the testing
          requirement has been finalized. Once ready, our suppliers ship the
          product to the nominated testing lab. As soon as the reports are
          available, we will share the same with you.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">
          Your checkout mentions that Freight, Taxes and Duties are ‘estimates’.
          When will I know the freight, duties and taxes that will be charged?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          The reason we mention Freight, Taxes and Duties as estimates at the
          time of placing the order is because we have seen variances in the
          volume of the finally packed goods (especially for orders with mixed
          items from multiple sellers), furthermore, duties and taxes for
          certain products to countries can also periodically vary.<br></br> At
          the time of dispatch however, we have the final actual packed
          shipments (from across suppliers if that be the case) and have handed
          it over to the freight company, at which point we get an exact freight
          cost from them.<br></br> We will therefore be able to inform you of
          the final freight, duties and taxes as soon as the order is shipped.
          <br></br> Until goods reach the destination and customs is cleared and
          we receive the invoice from the freight company, there are still
          possibilities of variance in tax and duties but those are usually
          minimal. Any such differential amount after the actual freight, duties
          and taxes is confirmed to you is neither charged extra, nor refunded.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">What is a Pro-forma invoice?</p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          A proforma invoice is a preliminary copy of invoice sent to buyers in
          advance of a shipment or delivery of goods. Pro-forma invoice
          typically describes the cost of purchased items and the estimated
          freight and estimated customs, duties and taxes. We share the Proforma
          Invoice, immediately after you place the order in case of a ready to
          ship order or within 24 hours of placing a custom order.
          <br></br>
          After you have placed an order on our site, we may reach out to you
          for certain documents that may be required by this Shipping company to
          clear customs into your country.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">
          How can I get the invoice for my order?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          We will email you a copy of the invoice with the final billing amount
          at the time of dispatch. We also share a final invoice with all
          necessary documents within 24 hours of successful delivery.
          Alternatively, once your order is delivered you can download the
          invoice from the Order section in your My Account page on Qalara
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">
          Payment for my order failed, what should I do?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          It’s pretty simple! Just go to the My Order section in your My Account
          page and you will find the order for which the payment failed. Against
          the order you will have an option to <b>Retry Payment</b>. Just click
          on that link and you will be redirected to the Payment page for
          retrying payment.
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-question">
          Amount from my card was deducted but I didn’t get an order
          confirmation email?
        </p>
        <p className="faq-body-text-para">
          Although this is very unlikely but if this happens please check if any
          order for the payment you made is visible in the My Order section in
          your My Account page. If an order is created and is in Payment
          Unsuccessful state please write to us at{" "}
